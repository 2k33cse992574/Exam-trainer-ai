Refactor the system behavior and UI logic to eliminate system-prompt leakage
and redesign roadmap handling as feature-based flows instead of study modes.

DO NOT change backend AI capability.
DO NOT show system instructions in user-visible responses.

---------------------------------------
CRITICAL FIX 1: HIDE ALL SYSTEM PROMPT CONTENT
---------------------------------------

Under NO circumstances should the user ever see:

- System identity text
- Supported exam lists
- Internal rules
- Mode descriptions
- Tone instructions
- “You are Exam Preparation Accelerator…” style messages

The system prompt is INTERNAL ONLY.

User-visible output must contain ONLY:
- Academic explanations
- Roadmaps (when explicitly requested)
- Clear answers to questions

If system context needs to be acknowledged, do it implicitly,
never by printing context blocks.

---------------------------------------
CRITICAL FIX 2: DEFAULT BEHAVIOR = DOUBT SOLVER
---------------------------------------

The default behavior of the AI should always be:

- Exam-aware doubt solver
- Concept explanation
- Numerical problem solving
- Theory clarification

This is the PRIMARY experience.

No roadmap logic should activate automatically.

---------------------------------------
ROADMAPS AS FEATURES (NOT MODES)
---------------------------------------

Redesign “Follow Roadmap” and “Make Roadmap” as EXPLICIT FEATURES.

They should activate ONLY when the user clicks:

- “Generate Preparation Roadmap”
- “Create / Improve My Study Plan”

Until then:
- The AI behaves purely as an exam-specific doubt solver.

---------------------------------------
FEATURE ZONES (LOGIC)
---------------------------------------

1) Default Zone: Study / Doubt Solving
- User asks questions freely.
- AI answers strictly within selected exam context.
- No mention of roadmaps unless asked.

2) Follow Roadmap Zone (explicit entry)
- Triggered only when user selects:
  “Generate My Preparation Roadmap”
- AI switches to mentor-style planning.
- Produces structured, time-based plans.

3) Make Roadmap Zone (explicit entry)
- Triggered only when user selects:
  “Optimize My Study Plan”
- AI asks limited clarifying questions.
- Refines the student’s plan logically.

---------------------------------------
USER CONTEXT HANDLING (SILENT)
---------------------------------------

User context (exam, target, semester, etc.) must be:

- Used internally
- Never printed as a block
- Never announced before answers

Example:

❌ BAD:
“Your context: Exam JEE, Target 2026…”

✅ GOOD:
Just answer the question correctly at JEE level.

---------------------------------------
UI COPY CHANGES (IMPORTANT)
---------------------------------------

REMOVE:
- “Follow Roadmap” / “Make Roadmap” as default options

ADD:
Primary buttons:
- “Ask a Question”
- “Generate Preparation Roadmap”
- “Optimize My Study Plan”

This makes the product intuitive and professional.

---------------------------------------
AKTU SYLLABUS INTELLIGENCE
---------------------------------------

For AKTU:
- Treat syllabus as semester-wise.
- If semester is missing, ask once and remember it.
- Do NOT repeatedly ask for semester.

---------------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
---------------------------------------

After this update:

- No system text appears in answers.
- Students see clean academic responses only.
- Doubt solving feels instant and natural.
- Roadmaps feel like premium features, not forced flows.
- The app feels like a real exam platform used by institutes.
