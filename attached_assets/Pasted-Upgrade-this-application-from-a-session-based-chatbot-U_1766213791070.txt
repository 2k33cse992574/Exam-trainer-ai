Upgrade this application from a session-based chatbot UI to a
state-aware exam preparation platform with persistent user preferences.

DO NOT rewrite backend AI logic.
DO NOT break existing functionality.
Implement UI + state management + minor behavior upgrades only.

---------------------------------------
CORE BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) FIRST-TIME USER ONBOARDING (ONE-TIME ONLY)

When a user opens the app for the FIRST time:

- Show the guided setup screen:
  • Exam selection
  • Target year OR time remaining
  • Study mode (Follow Roadmap / Make Roadmap / Random Search)

- Save this information as USER CONTEXT (persistent state).

- After successful onboarding:
  • Do NOT show this setup again automatically.
  • Redirect user to the main workspace.

---------------------------------------

2) PERSISTENT USER CONTEXT (VERY IMPORTANT)

The system must remember:
- Selected exam
- Target year or time remaining
- Selected study mode

This context should:
- Persist across sessions
- Persist across page reloads
- Persist across “New Session” clicks

The system should NOT re-ask exam/target/mode every time.

---------------------------------------

3) EDITABLE SETTINGS (CHANGE LATER)

Add a visible “Change Exam Settings” option (button or link).

When clicked:
- Allow the user to update:
  • Exam
  • Target
  • Mode

- After updating:
  • Update stored context
  • Reflect changes immediately in the app
  • Update the context banner

---------------------------------------

4) CONTEXT BANNER (ALWAYS VISIBLE)

Show a sticky, non-intrusive banner displaying current context:

Example:
Exam: JEE | Target: 2026 | Mode: Follow Roadmap

This banner should:
- Be visible on all main screens
- Reassure users what context the AI is operating under
- Include a small “Edit” action

---------------------------------------

5) NO RE-ASKING ON NEW SESSION

Clicking “+ New Session” should:
- Clear only the conversation history
- NOT reset exam, target, or mode
- NOT trigger onboarding again

---------------------------------------

6) SCROLL FIX (CRITICAL UI BUG)

Fix the scrolling issue on the setup screen:

- Ensure the entire onboarding card is scrollable.
- Prevent content from being clipped on smaller screens.
- Use proper overflow handling (overflow-y: auto).
- Ensure mobile and desktop both scroll correctly.

---------------------------------------

7) EXAM-SPECIFIC SYLLABUS AWARENESS

Enhance exam intelligence (no UI needed, logic-level only):

- For AKTU:
  • Treat syllabus as semester-wise.
  • AI should understand queries like:
    “AKTU Semester 3 Engineering Mathematics”
  • Ask semester only if not already known.

- For JEE / NEET:
  • Follow NCERT-aligned chapter structure.

- For SSC / GATE / CAT:
  • Stay exam-relevant and avoid school-level explanations.

---------------------------------------

8) UI QUALITY STANDARD

The UI must feel:
- Professional
- Institute-grade
- High-tech
- Dashboard-like (not chat-like)

Rules:
- No conversational onboarding text in the main UI
- No emojis
- No casual language
- Use cards, labels, and sections
- Clean spacing and typography

---------------------------------------

SUCCESS CRITERIA
---------------------------------------

After this update:

- A new user sees onboarding ONCE.
- A returning user goes directly to the workspace.
- Exam context is remembered and editable.
- No scrolling issues.
- The app feels like a real exam preparation system,
  not a chatbot.

This product should be demo-ready for institutes.
