Redesign the home screen UI of this application to feel like a premium,
high-tech exam preparation platform (not a chatbot).

GOAL:
The UI should guide students step-by-step into structured exam preparation
instead of showing a generic “Enter topic” chat input.

DO NOT change backend APIs or AI logic.
Only rebuild the frontend UI and how user context is collected and sent.

-----------------------------------
NEW HOME SCREEN STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------

1) HEADER
Title: “Exam Preparation Accelerator”
Subtitle: “Structured preparation for competitive exams — not random answers.”

Clean, minimal, professional styling.
No emojis. No casual language.

-----------------------------------

2) GUIDED SETUP CARD (MAIN CHANGE)

Replace the single “Enter topic” input with a setup card containing:

A) Exam Selector (Dropdown)
Options:
- JEE
- NEET
- SSC
- AKTU
- GATE
- CAT

Label text:
“Select your exam”

B) Target Selector
Either:
- Target Year (e.g., 2025, 2026, 2027)
OR
- Time remaining (e.g., 6 months, 12 months)

Label text:
“Select your target year or time remaining”

C) Study Mode Selector (Radio buttons or cards)

Options:
1. Follow Roadmap
   Helper text:
   “Get a mentor-designed preparation plan based on your exam and time left.”

2. Make Roadmap
   Helper text:
   “Create your own plan and get it logically improved.”

3. Random Search
   Helper text:
   “Ask exam-specific doubts instantly.”

Primary CTA button:
“Continue”

-----------------------------------

3) CONTEXT BANNER (AFTER CONTINUE)

After the user clicks “Continue”, show a subtle context banner at the top:

Example:
“Exam: JEE  |  Target: 2026  |  Mode: Follow Roadmap”

This banner should persist so users always know their context.

-----------------------------------

4) MODE-BASED MAIN WORKSPACE

Based on selected mode, change the main content area:

• Follow Roadmap:
  Show a button:
  “Generate My Preparation Roadmap”

• Make Roadmap:
  Show small input fields:
  - Hours per day
  - Weak subjects (optional)
  Button:
  “Optimize My Plan”

• Random Search:
  Show a clean input box with label:
  “Ask an exam-specific question”
  (Do NOT use “Enter topic” wording)

-----------------------------------

5) INPUT PAYLOAD (IMPORTANT)

When sending data to the backend / AI, always send structured context:

Exam: <selected exam>
Target: <year or months>
Mode: <selected mode>
User Query: <user input or action>

Do NOT auto-prepend phrases like:
- “I want to study…”
- “Please start the session…”

Treat user input as a direct academic command.

-----------------------------------

6) DESIGN GUIDELINES

- Clean, minimal layout
- Card-based UI (not chat bubbles)
- Neutral colors (white/gray) with one accent color
- Professional typography
- No conversational UI elements

-----------------------------------

7) DO NOT DO

- Do NOT keep the old “Enter topic (e.g., Fluid Mechanics)” placeholder
- Do NOT expose system messages or onboarding text in the center UI
- Do NOT add animations, emojis, or chat-style fluff

-----------------------------------

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

When a user opens the app, it should feel like:
- an exam preparation system
- a structured academic tool
- something a coaching institute would trust

Not like a chatbot.
